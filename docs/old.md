## Context
SITL simulations often require manual parameter adjustments to calibrate behavior, affecting efficiency and consistency. The proposed project explores the integration of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques with Lua-based scripting to automate these adjustments, thus leveraging AI for dynamic decision-making during simulation runtime.

Reinforcement learning has proven effective in scenarios requiring adaptive optimization, such as robotics control and simulation parameter tuning. By experimenting with RL algorithms like actor-critic, SARSA, or Q-learning, the project will validate a concept that incrementally learns the effect of parameter changes on simulation performance, eventually leading to an automated, self-adjusting system.

## Objectives
**Develop a Reinforcement Learning Framework:**
Design a lightweight RL module using Lua (with optional Python interconnects) to implement methods including actor-critic, SARSA, and Q-learning.

Ensure modularity to facilitate experimentation with different RL strategies

**Automation of Parameter Tuning:**
Identify key simulation parameters that significantly influence system performance.

Implement an online learning mechanism where the RL agent incrementally adjusts these parameters based on real-time performance feedback.

**Performance Evaluation and Validation:**
Establish evaluation metrics to judge RL-driven parameter tuning improvements over manual calibration.

Run controlled experiments to compare system performance pre- and post-automation.

## Expected Outcome
**Lua Script with RL Capabilities:**
A functional Lua script that leverages online reinforcement learning to automatically adjust simulation parameters in a Gaazebo SITL setup.
Demonstrative Case Studies:
Documented experiments and performance evaluations showing the benefits and limitations of using RL in this context.

**Documentation and User Guide:**
Comprehensive documentation detailing script usage, underlying algorithms, configuration options, and guidelines for further development or deployment.
